Module 13

# Project Overview

Use the Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface (API) to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL.

# Goal

- Create a branch from the main branch on GitHub.

- Add, commit, and push data to a GitHub branch.

- Merge a branch with the main branch on GitHub.

- Retrieve data from a GeoJSON file.

- Make API requests to a server to host geographical maps.

- Populate geographical maps with GeoJSON data using JavaScript and the Data-Driven Documents (D3) library.

- Add multiple map layers to geographical maps using Leaflet control plugins to add user interface controls.

- Use JavaScript ES6 functions to add GeoJSON data, features, and interactivity to maps.

- Render maps on a local server.

# Deliverables

Used JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data, to add tectonic plate data using d3.json(), add the data using the geoJSON() layer, set the tectonic plate LineString data to stand out on the map

Added major earthquake data to the map using d3.json(), and a color and set the radius of the circle based on the magnitude of earthquake, and added a popup marker for each earthquake that displayed the magnitude and location of the earthquake using the GeoJSON layer. Used the Google Directions API to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen from the customerâ€™s possible travel destinations. Then, created a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary.
